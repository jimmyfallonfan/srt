1
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,030
Cases of homicide are rare.

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,320
Could it be because the weather is nice these days?

3
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,600
For the Jilgok-dong case,

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,160
one of the two must be captured.

5
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,430
The boss and the first team don't even pretend to hear.

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,170
What do we do?

7
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,360
We should move.

8
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,290
- We?
- Yup.

9
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,110
Me and you together.

10
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,660
Lee Ji-gu came here last year,

11
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,860
and asked for a refund of a prepaid coupon?

12
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,890
Yes, right.

13
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,230
I was not allowed to do this,

14
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,460
and I said I'd ask my boss,

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,930
and then I texted you, officer.

16
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,190
Good job.

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,400
He showed me the pictures long ago,

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,290
and it came back to me.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
Did he say he will come back?

20
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,820
"Internet cafè Oppa"

21
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,140
Are you happy to stay home without me on the weekend?

22
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,050
Are you with me now?

23
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,050
Then let's get married soon.

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,780
<i>"- Have you dozed off again?"</i>
- Now I'll stop talking.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,910
Continue.

26
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,990
"You understand why you should sleep more!"

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,760
"You put yourself in danger."

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,260
"You don't sleep enough,"

29
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,810
"because you also do some" private "work."

30
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,110
It's not that I can't sleep.
I just don't sleep.

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,710
I couldn't sleep,
so I took my place there.

32
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,630
Why didn't you catch
Lee Ji-gu and Hong San-oh three years ago?

33
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,690
Are there many people staying
in the dorm on weekends?

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,040
It's all busy for the "Math Olympics".

35
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,890
Why does a high school student also compete?

36
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,670
He has a major in science, like me.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,640
I understand your choice.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,040
It would be nice to order some sushi.

39
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,670
I don't want to eat sushi
unless I'm sure it's fresh.

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,140
When I come here, I want to cook you some hot food.

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,260
Can't you move to IPO?

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,120
I want to have hot soup every day ...

43
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,690
Our neighbor, Samantha.

44
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,180
Yup?

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,190
She is pretending to be worried about me,
but it embarrasses me.

46
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,290
He said he read that at least
six out of ten couples

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,120
they're considering getting a divorce,
and then she asked me if it was okay with us.

48
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,370
What did you answer?

49
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,720
I told her that 55% of couples who don't have sex get divorced.
And I asked her if it was okay between them.

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,710
Decision to Leave
<i>"The woman of mystery"</i>

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,550
After grabbing the rope
and climbing to the top of the mountain,

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,570
I think he both lost his grip and slipped
and slammed into several places.

53
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:03,000
Up there, over there, here and here.

54
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,680
Wear expensive headphones.

55
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,690
Ten o'clock on Monday.

56
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,360
We better go up.

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,210
Is the helicopter coming?

58
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,660
I've heard it's good to walk,
but why do we have to do it this way?

59
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,470
Because that's how the dead man died,
and we're the police.

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,330
So when we go down, will we fall too?

61
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,670
And will we hit our heads multiple times?

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Why does anyone think of climbing
such a mountain?

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,170
Shouldn't it be prohibited by law?

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,580
Oh, it really hurts!

65
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,530
Ah, so ok!

66
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,910
<i>"On the personal effects of Ki Do-soo, 60,
they are engraved with his initials."</i>

67
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,970
"He drank Soju."

68
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,160
"E Whisky."

69
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Please don't go near the cliff!

70
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,570
He retired after working as an official
at the Immigration and Foreign Affairs Agency,

71
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,440
and until before his death,
he was with a reporter from "Minger".

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,790
There he is.

73
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,240
If this is your daughter, she is very beautiful indeed.

74
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,760
Will I be able to find the sign?

75
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,010
His father is here.

76
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,560
I am Song Seo-Rae, the wife of Ki Do-Soo.

77
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,240
I don't speak Korean very well, because I'm Chinese.

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,580
She must be very shocked.

79
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,640
I was worried.

80
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,340
I was afraid he would climb that mountain
and never come back.

81
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,190
I was afraid he might die.
And at the end...

82
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,450
In the end...

83
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,010
He speaks Korean much better than me.

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
I want to find out the reasons.

85
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,420
Her husband died,
and she said she wasn't shocked.

86
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,360
What an extraordinary wife.

87
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Go tell her that for deaths without witnesses,

88
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,290
an autopsy is required.

89
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,640
Explain it to her in simple words,
since she is not Korean.

90
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,040
I don't think my wife would be surprised either.

91
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,040
He always said,
"I know it could happen,"

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,640
"that's why I don't want to marry a policeman."

93
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,700
A person who died for unknown reasons
in a place where no one has seen him,

94
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,710
requires that the body be examined.

95
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
This is the procedure.

96
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
Indeed no, it is a higher order.

97
00:08:26,130 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it easier if you say it like that?

98
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,830
Yup.

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,980
Easier.

100
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,640
I told her to call the police.

101
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,120
I asked her if she still felt like laughing
after seeing the fracture.

102
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,850
And he still wanted to smile.

103
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,920
This woman's body is very clean.

104
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,180
The wounds are probably internal.

105
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Wait a minute.
Give me the mouse.

106
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,510
What did my husband look like when you found him?

107
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,240
Do I have to put it into words, or do you want to see in the pictures?

108
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
With words.

109
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
No, pictures.

110
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,100
His eyes were open, I show him.

111
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,770
The head laceration
was the cause of immediate death.

112
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,850
It's the deep cut to the head that killed him.

113
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,830
There should have been a lot of blood,
but it was raining, so it was washed away.

114
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,560
It's a blessing that he died the way he wanted.

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,500
It is not destiny.

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did you see her smile?

117
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,490
He was a brave person.

118
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,420
"There's nowhere to go"

119
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,420
"Let me die like this"

120
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,660
"It's cruel"

121
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,230
"I'm so bad?"

122
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,490
"I'm so bad?"

123
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,830
We're fine, right?

124
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,030
Yup.

125
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,760
We have been very happy for 16 years and 8 months.

126
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,430
Do you count them?

127
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,340
As expected of a scientist.

128
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,440
They say sex is good for
high blood pressure and heart disease.

129
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,940
I've read the latest research that says
it's also good for cognitive function.

130
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,510
Oh, here we go again ..

131
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,220
We will do this every week.

132
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,710
Even when we fight.

133
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,960
Poisonous!

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,900
You were thinking about it, weren't you?

135
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,880
To the Jilgok-dong incident.

136
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,850
No.

137
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,250
It's the accident of a new case,

138
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,660
a young Chinese woman whose
husband died in the mountains.

139
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm sorry for your husband.

140
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,160
Seo-Rae goes to several elderly people,
who live alone from Monday to Friday.

141
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
He asked for Monday, right?

142
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,670
Our patients may not be able to
express themselves very well,

143
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,160
then the manager calls them one by one.

144
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,670
Yes, that's it, at 9:00.
Come and see.

145
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,490
I can check if the keeper,

146
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,200
is there or not.

147
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,540
Song Seo-Rae.

148
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,310
Monday... oh,
from "grandma" Lee Hae-dong?

149
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,160
I also called to confirm that day.

150
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm sorry but...

151
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,860
But can the lady answer the phone?

152
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,650
Hand! It is the keeper who answers!

153
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,180
How is Song Seo-Rae?

154
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,310
Our "grandmothers-customers" said:

155
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,420
"But is she a nurse or a niece?"

156
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,210
She is a nurse,
particularly good at injections.

157
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,300
He is an ace of our company.
He is our ace.

158
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,500
She is a horrible woman!

159
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
Look.
She took off the ring.

160
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,710
"Isn't it sadness
that hits people like waves?"

161
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,760
"Just as the ink spreads slowly,
there will also be people who slowly stain themselves."

162
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,860
Let me know when you publish your poetry book,

163
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,060
i will buy one.

164
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,190
Do you understand the bitterness of life?

165
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,180
Right?

166
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,550
You spend sad weekends with a beautiful wife.

167
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,560
"After sitting for 12 hours every day."

168
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,410
"Controlling illegal immigrants is hard work,"

169
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,080
"but the thought that you will climb a mountain,"

170
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,130
"makes everything more enjoyable."

171
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,370
A moment.

172
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,880
They also found another DNA
under Ki Do-Soo's fingernails.

173
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,700
We need to collect the skin cells
from your wife's mouth.

174
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,560
Ouch!
This word about oral epithelial cells.

175
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,070
How do we translate it for you?

176
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,660
When I think of something that gives me a headache,

177
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,710
all of a sudden,
all my gastrointestinal cells start to ache.

178
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,860
Go to eat.
But don't buy expensive food!

179
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,030
Agree...

180
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,260
"Under her husband's nails"

181
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,320
"They found another DNA"

182
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,090
<i>"You have to come to the police station
to have yours picked up."</i>

183
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
"I can not."

184
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,610
Why not?

185
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,020
"I'm working now."

186
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,460
Her husband died,

187
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,260
and she's back to work yet?

188
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,660
The death of my husband,

189
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,380
can't stop the care of the elderly that I follow.

190
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Oh yes.

191
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,650
"Ah, surveillance is my main specialty."

192
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,370
I heard you grew up in your grandmother's hands,
so I gave you Monday grandma.

193
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,390
Do your job well.

194
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,880
What time did Song Seo-Rae arrive on Monday?

195
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,000
Siri, play a song.

196
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,860
"The Mist" by Jung Hoon Hee.

197
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
What a great song.

198
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,110
I got it from Seo-Rae.

199
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:43,890
♫ I walk alone along this deserted road ♫

200
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Oh!

201
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,630
♫ Wrapped ... ♫

202
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Open your mouth.

203
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,970
I thought he couldn't come.

204
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,570
Thank you.

205
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,030
What do you like about Seo-Rae?

206
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,190
Beauty?

207
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,550
He can cut apples into very thin slices.

208
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,720
I pray until Friday evening,
for Monday to arrive faster.

209
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,740
In this way,
it seems to me that Monday comes really early.

210
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,820
Siri, play a song.

211
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,430
"The Mist" by Jung Hoon Hee.

212
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,530
What a great song.

213
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,250
I got it from Seo-Rae.

214
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,070
We had a fight.

215
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,420
My husband wanted to climb mountains.

216
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,110
I hate mountains.

217
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,850
He scratched her when you fought

218
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,070
why was she against him climbing the mountain?

219
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,260
Oh! Call a policewoman.

220
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,680
All right.

221
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,950
I need to take a picture.

222
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,810
All right.

223
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,570
Everything is alright.

224
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,340
Yes, he did.

225
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,600
Because he couldn't understand my Korean.

226
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,190
After it hurt her,

227
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,330
understood?

228
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
In the end, yes.

229
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,590
What did your husband say?
When did he see that he hurt her?

230
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,380
Poisonous!

231
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,920
Do-Soo is stopping me like this.

232
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,790
The DNA discovered under your husband's fingernails,
is that his?

233
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Is that so?

234
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,210
Yup.

235
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,750
Do you hate mountains so much, Seo-Rae?

236
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,930
<i>"Confucius said:
The wise love the water,the gentle the mountains"</i>

237
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,790
"I'm not a nice person"

238
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,510
"I like the sea"

239
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Yes me too.

240
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Come?

241
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,760
These are the dates you
went to the ER, right?

242
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,660
Did he hit you because you didn't want him to go to the mountains?

243
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,690
He is the only Korean,

244
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,170
who cried after hearing my story.

245
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,750
What kind of Korean?

246
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,670
The only one...

247
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
Cor...

248
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,330
Oh, I'm sorry.

249
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,550
I shouldn't laugh.

250
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,500
But you are very explicit.

251
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,100
When I'm not sure what
I'm saying in Korean,

252
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,920
then I laugh.

253
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,370
Stay seated

254
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,950
I'll buy you dinner.

255
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,150
How are you?
Everything is fine?

256
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,330
Thank you.

257
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,580
Did you eat well?

258
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
No.

259
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,830
But that...

260
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,570
Is it a "Sushi deluxe"?

261
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,550
Is it refunded?

262
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,350
Please come with me.

263
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,660
Leave it, we will come back here again.

264
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,360
It is waterproof.

265
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,520
Waterproof means that even if it is wet,

266
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,450
water cannot enter.

267
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,490
Nurses use a lot of waterproof products.

268
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,600
Ah...

269
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,480
Go back to the room by 6:50.

270
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,690
The women's bathroom is on the right.

271
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,390
17 August 2015.

272
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,460
The Coast Guard found Chinese illegal immigrants,

273
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,870
on a merchant ship in the port of Pyeongtaek.

274
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,660
Thirty-seven were deported.

275
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,530
You are the only one left in Korea.

276
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,880
Because I'm not like everyone else.

277
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,820
My maternal grandfather,

278
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,660
it was Gye Bong-seok,
of the Korean Liberation Army of Manchuria.

279
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,270
Chi?

280
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,500
Bong ... what?

281
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,770
Thanks to Ki Do-Soo, he received an award from the
"Order of Merit for National Foundation"
.
<i>"(Ed: Award for Meritorious Services

283
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This is me.

284
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,410
Okay, we'll be there in ten minutes.

285
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,550
Lee Ji-gu was seen at the Oppa.

286
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,210
OK understood!

287
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,400
Release Song Seo-rae.

288
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,400
And investigate Gye Bong-seok,
who was awarded by the Order of Merit for National Foundation.

289
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Yes, sir.

even if I don't have to use it,
it will make me feel safer.

293
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,930
Come here!

294
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,970
Lee Ji-gu!

Fuck yourself!

That's enough! I'm dying!

307
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Curse.

308
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Mulla!

309
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,870
I said let it go!

Enough now!

311
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,710
Oh? Why is it so dark in here?

312
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,730
What are you doing?

313
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,630
Come on, get up!

314
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,430
Why did you fall?

315
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,630
Go out.

It wasn't you, was it?

317
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,830

I realized that you cannot kill a person.

Go Min.

319
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,400
Hong San-oh killed her, right?

320
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,620
Guys, you won't catch Hong San-oh.

321
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Because?

322
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,310
Because childhood memories are so beautiful.

323
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,350
Instead of getting caught and going to jail,

324
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,660
he would choose to shoot the police and then kill himself.

325
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,820
He feels like committing suicide.

326
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,140
Didn't I tell you not to commit violence?

327

But wasn't a policeman hurt? Policeman!

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,720
I got hurt because I hit him.

329
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,800
What's the point of running with a gun?

330
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,730
You are out of breath and without resistance.

331
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,830
And then,

332
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,740
you have to let the suspect speak for themselves.

333
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,010
Why do you keep talking?

334
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,640
You don't listen to what the suspect says?

335
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,930
- Take Song Seo-Rae for example.
- What?

336
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,900
We should have watched her
and had a search warrant.

337
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,060
Officer Mi-ji, who did the work,
sent me the footage.

338
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,110
Song Seo-Rae was seen walking in and out
of her grandmother's house.

339
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,650
His alibi is proven.

340
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,830
Hi, Mi-Ji.

341
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,190
Didn't you say Hong San-oh has a lot of women?

342
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,840
Send me the list.

343
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,990
With special dates and events.

344
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,510
We attach it to the other information we have

345
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,090
Why would such a beautiful woman
marry an old man and live in Korea?

346
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,310
Just because...

347
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,420
she's young, beautiful and foreign, do you want to make her a suspect?

348
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,700
So admit she's cute.

349
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,410
It is reverse discrimination.

350
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,800
If the other person was not a woman or a foreigner,

351
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,960
and had it been a Korean man,
the chief would have immediately activated a stakeout.

352
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,490
Don't you care to check it ...?

353
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,540
What a talker!

354
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,510
"He didn't put the ice cream in the fridge."

355
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,890
"And he sleeps uncomfortably with the TV on."

356
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,110
Good morning.

357
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,720
Good morning!

358
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,580
Why do you say "good morning" all of a sudden?

359
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,030
Make people nervous.

360
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,460
Anyway I slept well.
I slept well.

361
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Miao?

362
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,130
"Did you kill the crow because I didn't feed you?"

363
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,390
"Do not do it again."

364
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,820
"If you want to give me a gift,"

365
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,360
"Bring me the heart of that kind detective."

366
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,320
I would like too,

367
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,620
"to eat ice cream for dinner."

368
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,010
"It's not good to smoke after eating."

369
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,370
He's crying ... finally.

370
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,320
Good morning ...

371
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,300
Good Morning capo.

372
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
The case of the Gusosan accident,

373
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,140
are you still following him?

374
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,070
Hurry up and close the case.
Follow something more important!

375
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,660
Like the Jilgok-dong incident!

376
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,130
Good morning!

377
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,050
- Come back soon!
- Until we meet again!

378
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,960
I hear the Gusosan case will be closed.

379
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,920
What is this Chinese document?

380
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,670
Are the investigations not finished yet?

381
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,120
There is no reason to suspect it was a murder.

382
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,070
Now I want to catch a killer,

383
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,200
in the Jilgok-dong area.

384
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,570
If it was a murder and Song Seo-Rae is the culprit,
she will have at least a life sentence when she returns to China.

385
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,890
I also sent you the translation of the document.
Look?

386
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,790
So.

387
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,220
Hong San-oh met several women.

388
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,480
See the report within two days.

389
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,760
Ah, it's only now that it begins ...

390
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,330
Cow!

391
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,830
Ah, look at the document again!

392
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,320
He killed his mother!

393
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,070
What are you doing outside in this cold?

394
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,950
"I like the idea of a foggy sea"

395
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,860
"Even if I go to Busan, there is the sea"

396
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,390
"I'm going to Ipo, and there is the sea"

397
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,060
"I am the man of the sea!"

398
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,110
Your mouth is full of sea.
But isn't your hometown inland?

399
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
Ah, I want to smoke.

400
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,900
You have to stop before it's too late.

401
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,780
I'll still get you some "dried Campanula".

402
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,810
Didn't you chew it to quit smoking?

403
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,660
Hi, Lee Ju-rim.
It's me.

404
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,600
Do you have any dried bellflower there?

405
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,770
My husband wants to smoke again.

406
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,900
He's out of stock since he quit.

407
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,130
Only for this time.

408
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:35,000
"Seo-Rae"

409
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,990
"What should I think."

410
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,900
"Come to my place"

411
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,290
Oh really.

412
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,240
Why do you ask a policeman to come to your house?

413
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,850
However, you come here often, don't you?

414
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,070
They say you killed your mother.

415
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,740
"The mountain of Homi in Korea,"

416
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,970
"is the area where your grandfather was born."

417
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,900
Your grandfather.

418
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,520
Go find him on the mountain.

419
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
Yup...

420
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,820
Kill me first.

421
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,400
I wanted,

422
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,780
take care of my mother,

423
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,650
that's why I became a nurse.

424
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,480
It's because I'm a nurse,

425
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,960
what are you asking me to kill you?

426
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,260
So I let her go the way
she expected me to.

427
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,970
With four Fentanyl capsules.

428
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,160
I took some for myself too.

429
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,310
Where did you put the Fentanyl?

430
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,390
Open up if you're curious.

431
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,660
Ki Do-Soo committed suicide, and left this behind.

432
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,900
<i>"I know you took money and meat from the Chinese
and Russians to keep them in Korea."</i>

433
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,670
<i>"I know that he manipulated the cards to make people without rights,
and that you often threatened to expel them if they didn't pay."</i>

434
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,580
<i>"You will lose your job and your pension
if this is disclosed."</i>

435
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,460
<i>"You will also lose your reputation as a civil servant
who has served the state for 25 years."</i>

436
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,920
<i>"If you don't reply to this letter,
I'll report you to the immigration office and the police."</i>

437
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Bene.

438
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Ki Do-Soo has been watching,

439
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,840
people's faces for more than 20 years and
stamp their passports,

440
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,890
expressionless and friendless.

441
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,120
Why did you get involved with that kind of man?

442
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,400
<i>"In the height of summer,
I was trapped in a boat carrying fish"</i>

443
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,230
<i>"the boat drifted into the sea
for ten days."</i>

444
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,720
<i>"My face looked like a skeleton, and I was covered in shit and urine."</i>

445
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,350
<i>"I was going crazy."</i>

446
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,680
<i>"He saw me,"</i>

447
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,160
<i>"he smelled the smells I was wearing,"</i>

448
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,730
<i>"and listened to my story."</i>

449
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
<i>"Does your wife know?"</i>

450
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,900
<i>"What do you spy in someone's house at night?"</i>

451
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,510
I can't live with the brand of a corrupt official in my employ.

452
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,840
It doesn't matter what the cost is, but sooner or later I can

453
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,710
prove my innocence.

454
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,450
The police must know this document and make it known.

455
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,480
In fact, he was my boss when I was working.

456
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,090
- I understand. - I'm sorry!

457
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,190
Are you sure,

458
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,810
what is a farewell card?

459
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,990
Don't have a farewell ticket?

460
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,010
You too.

461
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,310
You are no different than any other cop!

462
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,870
How can you be the youngest cop in history?

463
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,490
If it's no different than any other cop, I'm willing to dance!

464
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,550
Right,

465
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,340
the proof that she killed her mother is not proof that she killed her husband too.

466
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,420
But didn't you say so?

467
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,100
That killing is like smoking.

468
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,930
Only the first time is difficult.

469
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,930
Pronto?

470
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,310
I'm sorry.

471
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,270
Hey, Soo-wan.

472
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,310
Soo-wan, let's go.

473
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,330
Yup.

474
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,730
- You are here? - Yup.

475
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,750
Let's go home, rascal.

476
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,220
Hey, Jang.

477
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,230
Get up.

478
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,530
What the hell happened?

479
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,650
Here we go.

480
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,660
Oh?

481
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,710
Our group leader ...

482
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,500
Hey, let's go!

483
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,040
It looks a bit like a kitten, but it's actually quite a lion!

484
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,670
See you next time.

485
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,240
Let's go let's go!

486
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,850
The next time you kill your husband, you need to be careful.

487
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,890
Cow.

488
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,390
Jang, I have to take my bag.

489
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,670
Okay okay. Here we go.

490
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,370
Street! Street! Street!

491
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,490
- I used plain language, right? - Here we go.

492
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,260
I went all the way to come to Busan because I respect you.

493
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
No, you shouldn't have done that.

494
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,830
I have a question.

495
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,460
In the state that you are, ask no questions.

496
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,380
Why did you eat such expensive sushi with that woman?

497
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
You are completely insane.

498
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,320
Seo-Rae, can you put your feet up?

499
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,860
The incident case is closed.

500
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,820
Seo-Rae, you are no longer

501
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,550
a suspect.

502
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,350
You are happy?

503
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
What?

504
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,190
Why should I?

505
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,190
Instead you are right. I'm happy.

506
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,600
How come?

507
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,540
I just think ...

508
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,870
That we are no longer ...

509
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
We?

510
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
What?

511
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,580
Have you already had dinner?

512
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,790
Come?

513
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,900
Oh yes.

514
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,940
An icecream?

515
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,860
The only kitchen that I know and that I am capable of cooking,

516
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,620
it is Chinese cuisine.

517
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,600
Due to insomnia,

518
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,080
I do all kinds of things at night.

519
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,840
Ah, "insomnia" means you can't sleep.

520
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,880
Oh! My God!

521
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,370
Oh...

522
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,820
Those are the unsolved cases,

523
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,000
maybe new evidence will come, and so will I ...

524
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,550
An "unsolved case" is a case that has not been solved.

525
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,930
Unresolved case.

526
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,110
Do ants eat people?

527
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,790
Ah, that ...

528
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,610
The first to arrive are the flies.

529
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,450
About ten minutes later.

530
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,870
After sucking blood and secretions,

531
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,590
they lay eggs in wounds and orifices of the human body.

532
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,880
When the worms come out of there,

533
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,560
the ants flock to eat the worms.

534
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,150
And then the beetles, then the wasps. This is how humans start eating.

535
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,810
It tastes good.

536
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,640
I gave a prize to taste ...

537
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,840
That's why you can't sleep.

538
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,550
Because of the blood-filled images of the screaming dead.

539
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,130
That man was Jeon Hyo-seok was found,

540
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,450
on the mountain a month after his death.

541
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,880
Beside him was the ax that smashed his head.

542
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,830
Hong San-oh,

543
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,210
he is the real killer of the Jilgok-dong incident, but I can't catch him.

544
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,680
I look at these photos whenever I can.

545
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,550
After questioning more than a dozen of his ex-girlfriends,

546
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,090
I feel I am very close to taking it.

547
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,540
Have you already been in prison?

548
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,890
Yes, but only for a month.

549
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,950
He thought his girlfriend was dating another man, and he beat him up.

550
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,710
Are you more afraid of prison than of death?

551
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,620
Yes, so they say.

552
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,610
This boy intentionally beat him even with the knowledge that he was going to prison.

553
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,830
So that's the woman he loves to death.

554
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460
Oh Ga-In?

555
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,460
Escaped!

556
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,270
Follow him!

557
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,450
Hong!

558
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,290
I have the bullet in the barrel!

559
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,040
Oh Ga-In lives far away though.

560
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,520
She opened a beauty salon in the province of Gyeonggi-do.

561
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,230
And she got married.

562
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,070
In South Korea,

563
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,920
Do you stop loving someone you love when you get married?

564
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Hey, Hong San-oh!

565
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,340
Hong San-oh!

566
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,910
Hong...

567
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,190
Tu!

568
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,620
You didn't kill Beom for money, did you?

569
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,370
Right? I understood everything.

570
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,480
When you've been in prison for a month,

571
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,210
Beom touched Oh Ga-In, didn't he?

572
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
Actually I ...

573
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,400
Her husband beat her.

574
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,410
The husband beat the woman

575
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,100
You actually wanted to kill her husband.

576
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,380
Why are girls with certain assholes?

577
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,530
I'm an asshole too though.

578
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,760
I know it!

579
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,570
No, why do you say you're an asshole?

580
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,930
You truly love Ga-In.

581
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Right?

582
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,240
Haven't you given up everything for Ga-In's sake? Son of a bitch.

583
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,260
You gave up ...

584
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,960
Please, you have to tell Ga-In ...

585
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
that even though I suffered a lot because of him,

586
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,450
without her my life is empty.

587
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,520
Please tell her like this.

588
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,120
Hong San-oh!

589
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,290
Do not do it!

590
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,780
It seems you don't have to say these words to her.

591
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,850
"Stai bene?"

592
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,990
"What cop would let someone like him come home right away?"

593
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,790
"Do you want me to come to Busan?"

594
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,670
No, no, there is no need.

595
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,950
"But anyway, every time you cry, I ..."

596
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,180
I'm not crying.

597
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,090
"For real?"

598
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,680
I need to go to the toilet.

599
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,780
Oh alright.

600
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,100
Now I'll hang up.

601
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,590
"After a demanding investigation, they finally found him"

602
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,230
"After killing her husband, Mr. Kang,

603
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,450
"It was confirmed that he and Oh lived together."

604
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,160
Who is?

605
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,210
It is you?

606
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,300
Ah, I told you there was no need to come ...

607
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,860
Some problems?

608
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,010
I want to make you sleep.

609
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,310
Do you think I am one of your elders living alone?

610
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,970
Are you going to massage my arms and shoulders?

611
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
What are you doing?

612
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,470
Didn't you say these are unsolved cases?

613
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Ecco.

614
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,760
I also burn my husband's photo.

615
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,930
This is too dark.

616
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,070
You were pretty even so.

617
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,790
What did you say about me?

618
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,600
Try saying it in Chinese.

619
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,740
You're pretty.

620
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:35,950
You're pretty.

621
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,640
You can keep one.

622
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:50,190
I'll keep this.

623
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,150
Also this.

624
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,090
It's this one.

625
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,410
This is better, right?

626
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,060
Will you be able to sleep well now?

627
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,060
I'm not sure.

628
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,980
I have a method.

629
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
Method?

630
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,380
It is a method used by the US Navy.

631
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,070
I have been in the Navy.

632
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,240
What has the US Navy developed?

633
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,340
Close your eyes.

634
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,720
Do you really want my heart?

635
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,470
Heart?

636
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,160
What will you do with my heart?

637
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,050
Oh...

638
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,840
I meant that I'll put you at ease,

639
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,420
not that I'll take your heart.

640
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,860
Ahh...

641
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,470
Sleep.

642
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,200
Hear the sound of my breath.

643
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,330
Harmonize your breath with mine.

644
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,180
Now you are at the sea.

645
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,700
You dive into the sea.

646
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,530
You are now a jellyfish.

647
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,550
You have no eyes or nose.

648
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,120
You are not thinking about anything.

649
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,020
Are not you happy,

650
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,770
nor sad.

651
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,190
You are emotionless.

652
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,210
You're pushing the water away,

653
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,920
push away everything that happened today,

654
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,950
you push it towards me.

655
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,150
Wait up.

656
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,740
Korean women have a lot of problems with their hands, right?

657
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,700
Don't healthcare workers use gloves?

658
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,080
The calluses on your hands are ...

659
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,790
I felt good from the start.

660
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,020
Because the cop in charge of my case has class.

661
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,970
You're saying being a cop is classy

662
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,050
How a Korean?

663
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,660
As a boyfriend?

664
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,630
Like a modern man.

665
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,400
Song Seo-rae, what era do you come from?

666
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,780
Tang Dynasty?

667
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,850
Why don't you ask me why I like you?

668
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,770
If you know, are you afraid to think so?

669
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,240
I already knew that you and I were on the same frequencies.

670
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,240
When I asked if you wanted to see your husband's photos.

671
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,920
You said no earlier.

672
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,980
I always have to look at them,

673
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,580
I do my best to look at them down to the smallest detail.

674
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,230
If you look at the bodies at the crime scene, half of the corpses have their eyes open.

675
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,410
I promise I'll catch the last one those eyes saw.

676
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,420
What scares me is a crime scene with a lot of blood.

677
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,380
Because of the smell.

678
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,940
Oh...

679
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,980
That's why you always have a good hand cream with you, right?

680
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,100
Do you have anything else with you?

681
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,320
Seo-Rae, what are you afraid of?

682
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,610
You're a nurse, it definitely won't be blood.

683
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,950
Height.

684
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,480
Ah...

685
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,920
Your pockets ...

686
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,160
I have 12 on my jacket and 6 on my pants.

687
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,400
It was made to order in the shop I always go to.

688
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,940
I helped them with a case, so they give me discounts.

689
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,470
So if I have to go straight to the scene ...

690
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,780
But I would also wear it on my day off ...

691
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:16,470
It's not like a person can't kill someone even if it's my day off, right? ...

692
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,150
I don't always wear the same clothes, don't get me wrong ...

693
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,140
I have many clothes ...

694
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,160
I am...

695
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,100
... a neat person.

696
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,960
"He opens the book and the notebook, side by side."

697
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,300
"No matter how long it takes, just keep writing."

698
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,270
"Even if he's writing,"

699
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,660
"look at his phone often."

700
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,170
"Or maybe he's looking at a translation dictionary."

701
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,030
"Now he's watching the drama on TV again."

702
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,560
"Speak to yourself while watching him."

703
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,040
"Why look at the historical drama,"

704
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,920
"vecchio stile?"

705
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,880
"He's eating ice cream for dinner again."

706
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,530
"It's not good to smoke after eating."

707
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,710
"She's crying ... finally."

708
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,390
Oh shit!

709
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,820
I know it's a dirty word.

710
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,100
Before the Buddha, it's really ...

711
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,120
You will delete the registrations,

712
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,780
if the accident case is closed, right?

713
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,560
Right.

714
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,910
Your password is the day your mother died, right?

715
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,430
If you are using personal event numbers,

716
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,600
many times this is useful for investigations.

717
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,970
As the case is closed,

718
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,520
I'll forget that number too.

719
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:30,240
♫ I walk alone along this deserted road ♫

720
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:35,320
♫ Enveloped in a thick blanket of fog ♫

721
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,400
♫ Your shadow and your kind memories ♫

722
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,500
How did you get to know this old song?

723
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,540
Everyone who lives in this neighborhood knows it.

724
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,990
Here is a classic.

725
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,290
The "Twin Flames" also sang it.

726
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
For real?

727
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,090
I smell cigarette!

728
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,460
You have smoked!

729
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Cigarettes!

730
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,780
Ah it's Soo-wan, he's really a scoundrel!

731
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,040
He never does what I tell him.

732
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,620
It will give me lung disease ...

733
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,340
"Are you sleeping?"

734
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,330
"I'm in the hospital, an elderly lady's condition has been critical since Tuesday."

735
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,150
"Ah..."

736
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:02,150
"He said he wanted to see me, but when I got here he was unconscious, so I keep waiting."

737
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,190
"Oh..."

738
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,910
"How do you go about Monday grandmother?"

739
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:21,770
"In fact, I'm worried."

740
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,610
"Do you want me to go?"

741
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:31,440
"For real?"

742
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:40,620
"An elderly man who lives alone is more important than a detective who cannot sleep."

743
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,530
"Ah ah if you like ..."

744
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:52,110
"So I"

745
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:55,130
"I'll contact you at 9"

746
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,460
"9 in the morning?"

747
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,480
"I'll ask the agency to send someone as soon as possible"

748
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,810
"So I"

749
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:08,830
"Take the green notebook from my table and read it"

750
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,060
"Poi"

751
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:15,090
"She likes a story"

752
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,120
"Sì"

753
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,850
If you go 250 miles east,

754
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,380
there is a mountain of water and oil.

755
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,660
The peaks of this mountain are hidden.

756
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,470
Only those who reach the top can see ...

757
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,440
Your hand is really,

758
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,010
softer than Seo-Rae's.

759
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,350
Maybe because Seo-Rae has calluses on his hands.

760
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,470
They have become like this lately.

761
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:11,960
At first the palm of his hand was as soft as lips.

762
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,540
Siri.

763
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,070
Play a song.

764
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,830
Who is? Who is the one who sings "The fog"?

765
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,670
This guy has been disobeying me lately.

766
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,070
You have the same phone as Seo-Rae.

767
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,700
Sure, because we bought it together.

768
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,210
You shouldn't open too many apps.

769
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,820
"Contapassi"

770
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:46,980
"Contapassi"

771
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,890
"138 Steps 26.10.2020 Monday"

772
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,030
Seo-Rae came to your house this Monday, right?

773
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,430
If it was Monday, she obviously will be here.

774
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,800
Looks like you two have gone somewhere.

775
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,310
I haven't moved from home for ten years.

776
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,810
Grandma, what day is today?

777
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,050
Where's the grandmother you talk about, brother?

778
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,700
I'm not sure what day it is today.

779
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,600
We who have read Haedong are intelligent, right? . "(Ed: collection of the lives of Korean Buddhist monks believed to be saints)"

780
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,530
And just in case,

781
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,290
seo rae

782
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,030
were you here today?

783
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,550
Then today would be Monday.

784
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,520
I set the time after Song Seo-Rae was photographed,

785
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,220
from the entrance and exit surveillance cameras.

786
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,920
Part.

787
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:16,510
It takes about 7 minutes to replace the phone and go.

788
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,940
If you go through the back window,

789
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,040
there are no surveillance cameras.

790
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,490
There are two paths.

791
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,700
An easy path and a difficult one.

792
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,400
But it takes roughly the same amount of time to reach the top.

793
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,410
Even though I usually take the hard way,

794
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:41,650
today, especially for beginner friends,

795
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,910
I'll take that easy.

796
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,400
"Song Seo-Rae must have chosen the easy way."

797
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,650
"Because she can't be seen like that by her husband."

798
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:52,540
Yes Boss. I'm on my way to work.

799
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,520
Yup?

800
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:54,750
I'm fine.

801
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:55,950
Yup.

802
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,410
"9:00 in the morning, the" Elderly Care "agency calls to ask where it is."

803
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,620
Don't be ashamed of slipping into a place like this.

804
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,050
The original name of "Bird Peak" was "the mountain of oil and water".

805
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,660
The name comes from the fact that it is as smooth as oil.

806
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,460
The scenery is not very pleasant, is it?

807
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,490
If you start listening to Mahler's Fifth Symphony,

808
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,560
when you get to the end of the fourth movement,

809
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:44,370
You will be almost on top of the mountain ..

810
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,630
Mahler's Fifth Symphony and then the descent from the mountain.

811
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,110
It's not perfect?

812
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,740
"The perfect way to kill someone."

813
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,250
"Song Seo-Rae must have hid here and then reached the top,"

814
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,590
"before the end of the fifth movement of Mahler's Fifth Symphony."

815
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,760
In the final part there are some difficulties.

816
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,130
But they are overcome.

817
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,310
Compared to the difficult path,

818
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:41,750
this is...

819
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,180
like eating sushi.

820
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,540
"If you take the ladder and go up,

821
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,240
you will hardly notice that your body has already reached the top.

822
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,130
"138 Passi"

823
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,460
"Korean women have a lot of problems with their hands, don't they?"

824
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,330
At 10:00

825
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,040
I'm on top of my favorite mountain. Gusosan.

826
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,010
"The dirty world is far away"

827
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,410
"I'm glad I died like this"

828
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,450
Aren't you afraid of heights?

829
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,780
Why did you kill him like that?

830
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,430
Is it branded like an animal?

831
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,820
And you didn't call the police.

832
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,270
Why don't you trust the police?

833
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,060
He said he was going to send me back.

834
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,860
In China.

835
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,080
Is that why you sent threatening letters to your husband?

836
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,000
It was a letter that would arrive anyway.

837
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,920
Because it's all true.

838
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,540
Did you find the letter Ki Do-Soo wanted to send to the immigration office?

839
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,560
But the address and name on the envelope were handwritten!

840
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
How did you do?

841
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,620
I edited the letter my husband wrote.

842
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,580
So it looked like a farewell note.

843
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:30,200
So when Soo-wan came to you, drunk, he wasn't violent with you, right?

844
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,840
It is not violent for the police,

845
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,010
go to a woman's house after drinking?

846
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,440
All the photos burned.

847
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,080
All files deleted.

848
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,400
It must have been easy for you.

849
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,430
Pretend you liked me

850
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,400
this way I did everything for you.

851
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,190
Don't talk about us like this.

852
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
We?

853
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,470
What kind of weather was that?

854
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:19,510
The time I spent outside the house every night?

855
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,800
Listening to the breath and falling asleep?

856
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,710
Whisper in my ear?

857
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,320
You said I have class.

858
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,810
Do you know where it comes from?

859
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,140
It comes from my pride.

860
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,530
I am a very confident cop.

861
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,010
But lately ... I've been crazy.

862
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:12,570
The investigation was corrupted, right?

863
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,850
And what about me?

864
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,060
I am completely destroyed.

865
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,020
You changed grandma's phone,

866
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,510
and you replaced it with an identical one.

867
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,730
She couldn't see it.

868
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,320
Throw that phone overboard.

869
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,650
In a place where it is deep.

870
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,540
Don't let anyone find it.

871
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,500
"Dictionary"

872
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:34,130
"Destroyed"

873
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:39,270
"1. Destroyed: Consuming oneself physically or spiritually "

874
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,040
13 months later

875
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:03,150
Stressors, such as not catching a criminal,

876
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,370
also manifested with sleep disturbances.

877
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,720
Well what he can do now is,

878
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:11,760
sunbathe thirty minutes before lunch,

879
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,230
can keep your clothes on, but keep your eyes open.

880
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,020
Doctor.

881
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,120
You opened a studio in Ipo not long ago, right?

882
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,310
Here, in the morning, the sun is not there,

883
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,400
because of the fog.

884
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,710
You have hot water in the house, right?

885
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,890
Yup.

886
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,390
So give him a foot bath before he goes to bed,

887
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,690
and I'm also going to prescribe you some dopamine.

888
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,990
You try it and in case it doesn't work,

889
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:48,980
i have this tool that helps to breathe through the nose while sleeping.

890
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,700
Oh yes this.

891
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:57,400
I've heard that pomegranate has the effect of delaying amenorrhea.

892
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:02,140
Wouldn't it be better to avoid it?

893
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,170
I know, even so,

894
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,040
Since you got back, I've been eating it at home every day.

895
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,420
I eat fresh pomegranates every day and feel healthier.

896
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,920
Why are you getting more and more wasted?

897
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,110
What do you say?

898
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,120
Do you think I'm a pomegranate?

899
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,710
Director Lee was surprised when he saw your photo.

900
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,350
How can such a beautiful person become like this?

901
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,610
56% of middle-aged men suffer from depression and become at high risk.

902
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,660
I heard that a man who Warden Lee met drank turtle essence.

903
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,630
It had a particularly positive effect on male hormones.

904
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,410
I'm really happy,

905
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,520
that you returned to Ipo.

906
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:58,630
I am also very happy too.

907
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:03,760
How can you be happy if you always think about murder and violence.

908
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,190
You want to die?

909
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,200
I asked you where your husband is!

910
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,850
He left me and ran away!

911
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,310
You are crazy!

912
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,410
What is it all about?

913
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,060
How can you buy all this if your husband ran away?

914
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,880
While you live like this,

915
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,640
my mother cries every day,

916
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:40,270
begging me to kill her.

917
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,970
What did the doctor say?

918
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,160
He said it won't last a month.

919
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,530
If my mother dies,

920
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:55,930
your bastard husband ...

921
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:09,190
I only put up with you for ten minutes.

922
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,040
You think about your mother.

923
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,610
Does your mother know that you are beating a woman?

924
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,730
Does she know what your nickname is?

925
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,160
If my mother dies,

926
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:27,530
I put it in the freezer,

927
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,250
then I kill your husband,

928
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,990
and then I give her the funeral.

929
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,910
I had so many difficulties in raising them!

930
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,780
Don't worry,

931
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,120
our foreman,

932
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,130
was the youngest person to be appointed superintendent,

933
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,760
and it is also the best here in Busan.

934
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,500
he is our group leader.

935
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,660
The stolen items were 58 indigenous turtles.

936
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,380
How much is the approximate amount of the loss?

937
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,070
More than 3 million Won at the market price.

938
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:58,830
Oh wow! How can they be so expensive?

939
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,640
Perhaps because it is said to be good for middle-aged men with depression.

940
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:05,230
Just like I said ... the youngest to become a superintendent!

941
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,740
How do you know?

942
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,140
Go outside and tell them to turn off the lights.

943
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,160
Yes, sir.

944
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,020
Bull, Dohyuk!

945
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:17,960
Are you stupid?

946
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,370
Didn't I tell you not to come?

947
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,630
This way I can see you.

948
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:30,270
There is no way out. What are you going to do?

949
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:38,670
"Honey, we have to get our things ready quickly."

950
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,440
Did you change the number again?

951
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,170
"Ah, hurry up and pack your bags."

952
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:43,940
"Cheol-seong found out where we are."

953
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,630
"And next week,"

954
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,070
"You have to help me host the Chinese."

955
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,390
"If they can't get to China, it will be a problem for me."

956
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,600
"Oh! What did you send me?"

957
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,520
"So he's already been there."

958
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,230
"I don't think we'll be able to see anyone for a while."

959
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:00,850
"I love you."

960
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,370
We're fine, right?

961
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,110
Let's forget about Cheol-seong.

962
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,400
Let's move first.

963
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,580
"We have to do it."

964
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,500
"Now that Cheol-seong has found you."

965
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,760
"where do you want to move?"

966
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,410
What is happening?

967
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:34,380
Is it a real fire?

968
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:36,140
Or just a fire drill?

969
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,770
If this time it's a fake fire, next time nobody will come out.

970
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,330
People say you're here because of the depression.

971
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,250
Because you failed to stop criminals from committing suicide.

972
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,160
But now you are healed.

973
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,740
Do you think I'm still depressed?

974
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,870
This is just because I can't sleep well, that's the real reason.

975
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,980
"Are you wearing shoes?"

976
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,900
You're not even smoking, why don't you come in?

977
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,790
Did you come to me because you saw me alone?

978
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,840
It is truly peaceful in this remote mountain village.

979
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,770
If you want to smoke, go out and smoke.

980
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,120
I love you.

981
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,230
What are you doing here?

982
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,260
I just moved.

983
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,640
How come?

984
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,380
There is nothing to see here.

985
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,370
I like the fog.

986
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,870
I'm Song Seo-Rae.

987
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,260
I'm Chinese so I don't speak Korean very well.

988
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,120
Tesoro.

989
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,030
Honey, this is the detective who suspected me.

990
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:35,720
Ah hi, I'm her "next husband".

991
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:37,770
Sono Ho-shin.

992
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,330
I'm Jang Hae-jun.

993
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:43,700
Why did you come to Ipo?

994
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,970
I just touched the fish.

995
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,570
Why did you come to Ipo?

996
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,860
I just moved in too.

997
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,630
My wife works here.

998
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,830
I'm Ahn Jung-An.

999
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:14,310
To this day, I have only heard of people who have left here because of the fog.

1000
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,460
I have never heard of people coming here because there is fog.

1001
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,720
Wait until you've seen how musty this place is.

1002
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,480
Honey, it really is.

1003
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,050
Actually, we came here because of the nuclear power plant.

1004
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,280
What? Something wrong?

1005
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,840
"Red alert"?

1006
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,250
Kim Woo-bin starred in a drama about a nuclear power plant accident.

1007
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:45,680
Her Chinese fans travel long distances just to see the filming location.

1008
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,040
So they need a tour guide, right?

1009
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,350
If you are making money this way,

1010
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,440
I don't want to be offensive,

1011
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:56,920
but a television drama based on a nuclear crisis that never happened,

1012
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,560
it's really just giving us big headaches.

1013
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,350
Ah, you work in a nuclear power plant.

1014
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,670
It is quite sensitive to these problems.

1015
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,140
In reality,

1016
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,940
nuclear power is completely safe.

1017
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:18,320
Ah, but do you work in the world of finance?

1018
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:19,730
Yes, did you see me somewhere?

1019
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:22,110
I am a stock market analyst.

1020
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,160
Not as written in Korean: "anal analyst" that is, who likes the anus!

1021
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,310
You look younger than you appear on TV.

1022
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,030
Swimming in the morning is my secret to staying young.

1023
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,340
If you want to have investment advice,

1024
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,920
feel free to contact me at any time.

1025
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,110
Please give me your business card too.

1026
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,930
Your business card is gorgeous ...

1027
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,990
There is no need to rush here.

1028
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,920
What a beautiful woman.

1029
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,520
Yup,

1030
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,800
the green dress was beautiful.

1031
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:39,230
But wasn't it blue?

1032
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,480
It was nice in any case.

1033
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,770
She is a widowed Chinese woman.

1034
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,160
Did you tell me about that case?

1035
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,260
I remember hearing of a case where the Chinese wife

1036
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,850
she had committed suicide and her husband was left a widower.

1037
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,600
Yes, there was such a case.

1038
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,390
Her last husband was a criminal, right?

1039
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,440
No.

1040
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,560
I suspected the wrong person.

1041
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,080
Did you have any suspicions about that woman?

1042
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:11,130
Yup.

1043
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,490
But it turned out that her husband committed suicide.

1044
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:16,620
Why do you always suspect the wrong people?

1045
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,370
That's why people hate us.

1046
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,490
We?

1047
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:25,350
We, the police.

1048
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,100
Honey, do you answer the phone?

1049
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,710
My hands are covered in blood.

1050
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,640
Pronto?

1051
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:03,530
Tesoro.

1052
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:05,990
Congratulations.

1053
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,830
There is a murder.

1054
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,460
The estimated time of death is around 11.

1055
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,280
He was allegedly stabbed 17 times.

1056
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,630
There are 13 stabs in the stomach and chest,

1057
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,570
and 4 stabs in the back.

1058
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:29,120
He must have been stabbed in the back as he ran away.

1059
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,150
Can anyone escape with 13 stab wounds to the body?

1060
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:37,310
By the way, why is the body in that position?

1061
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,050
The first person to find him was his wife.

1062
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,820
Foreman, should I bring her here?

1063
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,660
"The murderer is left-handed"

1064
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:28,630
You write.

1065
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,490
Is that why you came to Ipo?

1066
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,220
Do you think I'm a chicken?

1067
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,430
Am I that bad?

1068
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:11,520
Song Seo-rae, listen carefully.

1069
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,380
An alibi this time,

1070
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,770
it must be hard, like the rock under our feet!

1071
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,720
Do you think your wife is the killer?

1072
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,220
How come?

1073
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:28,110
Because there is no sign of invasion, no sign of theft,

1074
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,200
no sign of binding?

1075
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,140
Because of the stabs in the chest?

1076
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,960
Do you think this is a revenge murder?

1077
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:38,080
Or maybe because his wife wasn't shocked or sad?

1078
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:42,070
It varies from person to person, some people grieve, others are colder.

1079
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,690
Why do you always ask me so many questions?

1080
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,610
Why don't you do it to others too?

1081
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:54,720
I met her in Busan last year, in the case of the mountain accident,

1082
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,530
where her husband died.

1083
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,030
Did she kill him?

1084
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,960
I wondered if she could be the killer.

1085
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:06,850
That case was classified as a suicide.

1086
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,880
And now, her new husband is dead here, and still under my jurisdiction.

1087
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:11,670
But she is right-handed.

1088
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:14,370
So think about it!

1089
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:16,060
How could she be a criminal?

1090
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,120
They want me to go to the police station

1091
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,670
Can i take my handbag?

1092
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,130
You went for a walk.

1093
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,150
And you didn't have a cell phone with you, so there's no way to track your location.

1094
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:35,680
Can you prove your alibi?

1095
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:37,580
I know it.

1096
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,200
You don't seem to be worried.

1097
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:45,400
Did your husband have enemies?

1098
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,150
I read that he borrowed some money,

1099
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,970
invested a lot and lost a lot.

1100
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,770
He's been losing a lot of money lately.

1101
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,540
Did you lose money and still live in a luxury villa?

1102
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:59,010
In order to have money, you need to demonstrate that you have a certain lifestyle.

1103
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,820
Why did you marry such a man?

1104
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,040
I married a man ...

1105
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:13,880
but I was deciding to leave him.

1106
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:23,110
Why did you come to Ipo?

1107
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:26,890
No particular reason.

1108
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,550
If there is one, the creditors will find me.

1109
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:44,500
You don't marry a man simply because you love him.

1110
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,590
Your husband gets threats.

1111
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,660
And then it dies.

1112
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,840
Like last year.

1113
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:53,460
What?

1114
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:56,650
My previous husband committed suicide.

1115
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,680
This husband was murdered.

1116
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,820
Bene.

1117
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,650
Your two husbands,

1118
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,070
in areas very far from each other,

1119
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,360
in remote jurisdictions,

1120
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,720
one committed suicide and one was killed.

1121
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:19,330
If people hear something like this,

1122
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:20,890
it's sure they wonder,

1123
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,340
if it is pure coincidence.

1124
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,390
What do you think people would say?

1125
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:37,300
What a poor woman.

1126
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,580
This was not the dress, it was a blue dress,

1127
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:27,950
and the coat was not there.

1128
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,560
Are you sure it was blue?

1129
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:31,260
Not green?

1130
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:32,930
Thank you.

1131
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,660
He's right, it's blue.

1132
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:41,030
What was he doing?

1133
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,260
Tell me the truth...

1134
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,360
why did you come to this place?

1135
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,450
Why do you keep asking?

1136
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,570
Do you care just why I'm here?

1137
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,660
Because it's important?

1138
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,240
This is the only way I can see you. What can I do?

1139
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:29,500
What were you wearing on the walk you took to Haenyeo Pier?

1140
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:32,930
This.

1141
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,680
You're lying.

1142
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:36,940
Where is the green dress?

1143
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,060
The green one that looks blue.

1144
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,390
With shiny buttons.

1145
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,310
Did you take a closer look?

1146
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,360
I'm not going to start over.

1147
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:56,910
Ah, sorry, sorry!

1148
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,290
You are here!

1149
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,220
Did you see what happened?

1150
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,510
Wow! We have a murder in our village!

1151
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,630
Ouch! I'm sleepy now!

1152
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,040
What should I do at night?

1153
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,470
After I got back from the walk,

1154
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:36,780
the smell of blood was sickening.

1155
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:41,930
I thought about you.

1156
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,290
That you would definitely come here.

1157
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,060
And what you told me about your fear of blood.

1158
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,780
Song Seo-rae.

1159
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,730
You just admitted that you took out all the most important evidence of the murder.

1160
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,010
As a suspect in the murder of Lin Ho-shin,

1161
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,940
I'm putting you under arrest now.

1162
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:52,440
"I don't like the police following my husband."

1163
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,850
We have this smartwatch, right?

1164
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,910
Extract the audio file.

1165
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,050
The language will be Chinese,

1166
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:02,470
so please find someone to translate it.

1167
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:03,490
Yes, sir.

1168
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:08,280
You are a male?

1169
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:09,710
No.

1170
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:13,030
Have you ever killed anyone?

1171
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:15,230
Yup.

1172
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:20,310
Did you kill your husband, Lin Ho-shin?

1173
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:27,770
No.

1174
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:52,810
Gentleman.

1175
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,770
What are you doing here?

1176
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,230
This is the recording extracted from the smartwatch.

1177
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:17,630
As he asked, we checked the license plates around the mansion before and after the murder.

1178
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:20,790
Among them is that of a person who was scammed by Lin Ho-shin.

1179
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,980
He is the leader of a gang.

1180
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,590
His name is Sa Cheol-seong.

1181
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,800
Is there anyone else with the surname Sa?

1182
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,230
Mollami!

1183
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,170
Are you OK? Come up.

1184
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:44,850
Call me!

1185
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:49,830
Call me!

1186
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:50,850
Mamma!

1187
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:55,130
He is left-handed.

1188
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,720
270 million Won!

1189
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,680
My mother had been running a food stall for ten years,

1190
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:03,270
and she had managed to open a Chinese restaurant.

1191
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:05,370
He worked eighteen hours a day.

1192
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,170
I trusted Lin Ho-shin, he was rich, and I gave him all that money.

1193
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,630
In the beginning it was only 10 million Won.

1194
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,560
And he paid the dividends little by little,

1195
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:15,720
it's always nice to get interest.

1196
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,570
Then he convinced me to give him all the savings.

1197
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,780
But then I knew he was going to all places,

1198
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:22,550
where you gamble,

1199
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,530
and he bought his wife bags and expensive clothes!

1200
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:26,650
He spent my money like a pig, that son of a bitch!

1201
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:28,880
In all, he had raised 10 billion Won.

1202
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,770
My mother had severe diabetes.

1203
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:35,190
And he also had a nervous breakdown,

1204
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,610
after learning that the money was gone.

1205
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,330
Kidney complications have also arisen.

1206
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,840
Because he didn't get the proper treatment!

1207
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,200
They had to amputate her ten toes !.

1208
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:46,090
Do you know why my nickname is "Wa-Sung"? . "(NdT: Iron stone)"

1209
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:49,030
Because I'm good at slapping people with this iron hand.

1210
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:50,390
That's why they call me "Wa-Sung".

1211
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,820
Because I don't hit with fists, but with slaps.

1212
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:55,500
Slaps can be given many and they hurt more than punches.

1213
01:40:56,610 --> 01:40:57,900
But I...

1214
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,830
I didn't kill Ho-shin.

1215
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:01,250
That beast!

1216
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,830
You know Song Seo-Rae.

1217
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:05,950
Did you ask Song Seo-Rae to kill her husband?

1218
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,740
Actually I ...

1219
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:13,520
I'm not the kind of person who can tell others what to do.

1220
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,810
Song Seo-Rae, it really helped me.

1221
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,920
But he will never know,

1222
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:20,010
who cannot escape from me,

1223
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:21,970
No matter how many times he tries!

1224
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:29,260
I have installed tracking software

1225
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,910
on my smartphone.

1226
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,280
Wow, is this Ho-shin?

1227
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,690
Why is he sitting like that?

1228
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It's scary.

1229
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,380
Son of a bitch.

1230
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:51,100
Do you want me to slap you hard today?

1231
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,500
Did you understand?

1232
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,140
Foreman, aren't you happy?

1233
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:04,770
Why should I?

1234
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:08,430
We solved the first murder case in Ipo, right?

1235
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,620
What is the best place to dine?

1236
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,520
Case solved?

1237
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:14,640
Who said the case is solved?

1238
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:15,880
Now that the criminal has been caught,

1239
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:18,240
they should be able to allow Song Seo-Rae to return home.

1240
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:19,820
That's what I thought.

1241
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,770
The turtle thief is on the run on a motorcycle,

1242
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:24,700
direction Greenstone Walls, third intersection from the sea.

1243
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,280
I repeat! Greenstone Walls, third intersection from the sea.

1244
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:43,950
Hey, alright. Stand still!

1245
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,710
Let's gather the turtles!

1246
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:50,590
Hurry!

1247
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:52,170
You on your feet!

1248
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,680
Load it on your back, we have to take it away.

1249
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:54,170
Yes, sir.

1250
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:56,260
Hey, hey. Jump on my back!

1251
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:57,760
Let's get the big ones first.

1252
01:42:57,790 --> 01:42:59,230
Watch out for your fingers! They bite!

1253
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,240
We caught the turtle thief.

1254
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:25,720
The husband of a woman I have known,

1255
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:27,970
he called me in the middle of the night,

1256
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:29,670
twice.

1257
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,160
A man met by chance.

1258
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,500
Wrong number?

1259
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,520
I might as well think this.

1260
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:45,300
But what if that man is killed after a few days?

1261
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,480
Tesoro.

1262
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:56,330
Did you kill him?

1263
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,400
Did you and his wife kill him together?

1264
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,200
How are the fingers?

1265
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:13,970
This is the number of another cell phone Lin Ho-shin used.

1266
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:15,720
Monitor where he was before he was killed.

1267
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:21,930
"Take the opportunity! Open up to a new world!"

1268
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:24,290
Gentleman.

1269
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:25,810
Yup?

1270
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,620
Why was the phone here when the owner died at home?

1271
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:36,230
Here the owner's phone turns on and off.

1272
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,980
Put your arm one more time,

1273
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,360
and raise your hand a little higher.

1274
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,010
Oh, my arm hurts.

1275
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,040
Stop like this!

1276
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,860
He was throwing away the phone!

1277
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,180
Call the divers and let's start looking in the area.

1278
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,380
Does it have to be under there?

1279
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,330
One moment, one moment!

1280
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:01,250
We have already caught the criminal!

1281
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:03,220
There is evidence and we have a confession!

1282
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:06,270
Please, stop being obsessed with your wife.

1283
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,300
Doesn't he have pity on her?

1284
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,720
"Are you wearing shoes?"

1285
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,160
"I can see his beard."

1286
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:32,580
" He's lazy to shave,"

1287
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:33,970
"in the morning and in the evening?"

1288
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:39,380
"He seems devoid of energy ... Is it because he didn't see me?"

1289
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:50,610
"When he made me that strange Chinese food,"

1290
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:52,280
I smoked next to him,

1291
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:54,910
and couldn't stand the smoke.

1292
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:58,010
All he had to say was "I love you".

1293
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:03,670
I remember the nights that stole my sleep.

1294
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:06,780
I felt he was a reliable man,

1295
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,460
who can't sleep,

1296
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:12,510
that was protecting me.

1297
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,900
He is on his way here.

1298
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:16,710
As soon as he sees me,

1299
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:19,160
he will ask me why I am here in Ipo.

1300
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:21,030
What should I do?

1301
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,880
Why do you keep crying,

1302
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:26,030
Song Seo-rae?

1303
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,840
Do I have to answer him?

1304
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,280
No.

1305
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,270
He could...

1306
01:46:38,710 --> 01:46:40,090
I already know.

1307
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,210
I don't know if he will ask me.

1308
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:49,670
Is that why you came to Ipo?

1309
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,720
"Ciao."

1310
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:02,750
What's on that phone?

1311
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:03,870
Answer me.

1312
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,490
Open the door, hurry up.

1313
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:10,070
"I'm not at home."

1314
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,620
So, where are you?

1315
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:13,290
"Towards the mountain of Homi."

1316
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:17,570
What's in Lin Ho-shin's phone you threw overboard?

1317
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,220
"Don't fall asleep."

1318
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,520
"Hold on a little longer."

1319
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,730
"There is no fog here."

1320
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:27,950
Why did Lin Ho-shin call my wife?

1321
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:33,580
"" My mom liked this mountain. "

1322
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:35,050
"He often told me,"

1323
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:37,270
"when I was angry."

1324
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,830
"If you go to Korea, there is your mountain"

1325
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,080
Tell me the truth.

1326
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:50,740
You also knew Lin Ho-shin was going to call

1327
01:47:51,230 --> 01:47:52,260
my wife, right?

1328
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:54,590
"Despite the fact that they did not spare at the trial"

1329
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:56,240
"the most atrocious phrases they could tell me"

1330
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,390
"I don't care what people say"

1331
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,030
"In my heart was the mountain of Homi. My mountain."

1332
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,990
Mamma.

1333
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,360
Not no.

1334
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:21,480
I brought a man I can trust.

1335
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:36,750
Help me.

1336
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:40,170
You know I'm afraid of heights.

1337
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:52,120
Why did I marry certain men?

1338
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:58,470
Because an ideal man like you wouldn't marry me.

1339
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,520
To be able to see and talk to you,

1340
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:03,650
murder must happen.

1341
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,660
Is this the time to joke?

1342
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:22,750
"Since I left you, you can't sleep well anymore, right?"

1343
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,920
"Even if you close your eyes, you always see me, don't you?"

1344
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,260
Tell me if that's not the case.

1345
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:43,980
That time you met me at the market,

1346
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,700
suddenly you felt like you were alive again, right?

1347
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:49,380
And finally.

1348
01:49:55,530 --> 01:49:58,290
Now my hands are soft, aren't they?

1349
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:14,530
In the past 402 days, you ...

1350
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:20,250
Butter...

1351
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:29,580
But even then,

1352
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:32,990
the fact that I'm a cop and you are the suspect won't change.

1353
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:40,340
You are a police suspect.

1354
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,000
I like.

1355
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:49,840
Feel comfortable and treat me as you always do.

1356
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:52,590
Treat me like a suspect.

1357
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:59,280
Aren't you wondering why I like you, Seo-Rae?

1358
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,980
Or just don't care?

1359
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And you?

1360
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:12,230
My body is stiff.

1361
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:13,940
I'm still!

1362
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:18,060
I'm not nervous, and I've always been honest.

1363
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,980
I think I told you I like you a lot.

1364
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:46,360
Why are the four Fentanyls here?

1365
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:08,570
I carried that vase back and forth,

1366
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:10,770
it is very heavy.

1367
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:16,560
Hello grandfather.

1368
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:34,730
Hello Mom.

1369
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:06,280
I told you to throw it away!

1370
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,560
Nobody has to find it!

1371
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:13,860
Use it to continue the investigation.

1372
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:17,310
Let's go back to the old days.

1373
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:46,910
Looks like I want you to solve the case ...

1374
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:48,430
that's why I came to Ipo.

1375
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,920
Director Lee!

1376
01:55:11,290 --> 01:55:12,290
Yup?

1377
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,880
You never met him before, did you?

1378
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,440
She said she recently divorced.

1379
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:20,890
I'm Lee-joon. I've heard a lot about you.

1380
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:34,700
Isn't it snowing here?

1381
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:36,590
What?

1382
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,490
How do we deal with this problem?

1383
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:50,540
What problem?

1384
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:52,120
"Even when we fight"

1385
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,010
"we will do it every week"

1386
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:56,990
Will you let me through?

1387
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,340
Can you sleep?

1388
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,850
I've been to the hospital to take a test,

1389
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:16,880
they said I woke up 47 times in an hour.

1390
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:20,340
Can you believe it?

1391
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,480
I wish I could transfer some of my sleep to you,

1392
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:26,740
just as if you were an electric battery.

1393
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,160
It is because of how I breathe.

1394
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:40,810
When I go to sleep, I have to use a device that makes me breathe through my nose.

1395
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,080
It's strange.

1396
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,970
When I'm awake, I breathe through my nose.

1397
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:04,170
But that does not mean that when I sleep I am Russian!

1398
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:10,030
I know it.

1399
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:21,650
Sunbathing,

1400
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,280
you take vitamin D.

1401
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,610
But is it good to do it for a long time?

1402
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:27,960
It's been 30 minutes.

1403
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,630
I told colleagues,

1404
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:38,360
that if they went fishing at Haenyeo pier, to see if they saw a cell phone.

1405
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:40,140
And in case they saw it, bring it to us.

1406
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,920
Of this ... Will it be possible to recover the contents?

1407
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,150
"Seo-rae"

1408
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,730
"I wanted to play this great audio file,"

1409
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:05,630
"to Hae-jun's wife."

1410
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:07,010
"But he doesn't answer."

1411
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:09,350
"If I call in the morning, I find her, right?"

1412
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:13,840
"Now I'm calling the Chinese!"

1413
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:15,820
"Do you want to be ruined?"

1414
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:18,800
"I'll be killed anyway"

1415
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:21,730
"Cheol-seong's Mom Won't Live Long "

1416
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:23,840
"That bastard finds me everywhere I go!"

1417
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:27,050
"Honey, if you can't get an answer,"

1418
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:28,150
"by tomorrow,"

1419
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:30,590
"I will upload this file to the Internet,"

1420
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:32,590
"so everyone will know,"

1421
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,680
"that for the police the suspects are not all the same."

1422
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:38,490
"I'll be having lunch with the Chinese the day after tomorrow,"

1423
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:42,120
"so come home by 10am tomorrow morning!"

1424
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:47,540
"I'll be having lunch with the Chinese the day after tomorrow,"

1425
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,000
"so come home by 10am tomorrow morning!"

1426
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:52,130
"Audio recordings"

1427
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:55,150
"No audio recording saved"

1428
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,470
On the morning of your mother's death, did you see Song Seo-Rae?

1429
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:09,940
She came early in the morning to visit her.

1430
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:17,220
She said she was sorry about the way my mother was.

1431
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,310
Because, after all, we are Chinese too.

1432
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:23,360
Did he advise you to give her some medicine?

1433
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,990
Something that's good for diabetes?

1434
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:28,600
It is a green pill.

1435
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:30,290
As a nurse,

1436
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,930
she is very good at taking care of her patients.

1437
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:37,910
He massaged her, and my mother was in a great mood.

1438
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,790
Then I went out for breakfast.

1439
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:44,030
Later, I learned that Song Seo-Rae was already gone.

1440
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:47,540
Mom lay down and closed her eyes.

1441
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:50,940
And strangely she fell asleep almost immediately.

1442
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:53,940
And then...

1443
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:02,800
But what does my mother's death have to do with Song Seo-rae?

1444
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:09,930
Didn't Cheol-seong say he had tracking software installed on his phone?

1445
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:21,700
Hi, Hae-jun.

1446
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,040
I recovered Ho-shin's phone.

1447
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,020
There is no registration.

1448
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:29,850
Who killed your husband was Sa Cheol-seong.

1449
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:32,010
But you killed his mother.

1450
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:36,290
Cheol-seong warned you that he would kill your husband if his mother died.

1451
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:41,480
Your husband and Sa Cheol-seong's mother,

1452
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,680
you killed them because of me, is that so?

1453
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,020
She was already a woman who was dying,

1454
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:58,070
why were you in a hurry to give her Fentanyl?

1455
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:01,470
Because he thanked me ...

1456
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:12,260
What is the recording that Lin Ho-shin said he wanted to reveal?

1457
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:14,260
Do not worry about it.

1458
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:17,200
I'm not asking because I'm worried.

1459
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,760
You have the original, right?

1460
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:21,370
Which recording is it?

1461
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,450
It is your voice.

1462
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:26,290
What?

1463
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:30,740
Your voice that says you love me.

1464
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:36,640
I said it?

1465
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,280
I like those two words so much, I keep listening to them.

1466
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,020
But my husband found out.

1467
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,680
When did I say "I love you"?

1468
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,080
When?

1469
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,270
"The moment you said you loved me"

1470
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:15,950
"Your love is gone"

1471
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:21,890
"The moment your love is gone,"

1472
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:25,190
"My love has begun."

1473
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:27,100
Please tell me in Korean.

1474
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:30,880
Seo Rae...

1475
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:34,610
Hae-jun...

1476
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:39,250
The cell phone you fished out of the sea,

1477
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:41,480
throw it back into the sea.

1478
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:48,350
But throw it in a deep place ...

1479
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:51,720
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

1480
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:53,500
It is really frustrating!

1481
02:02:56,130 --> 02:02:57,290
Seo-rae, where are you going?

1482
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,160
Seo-Rae.

1483
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:04,050
Seo-Rae?

1484
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,320
Seo-Rae.

1485
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:34,270
Seo-Rae!

1486
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:18,010
"It breaks down and awakens"

1487
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,720
"You burned all the photos."

1488
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:38,710
"Io...*

1489
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:12,300
It should be easy to delete all audio files.

1490
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,860
Pretend to show you like me

1491
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:17,150
so that I take care of everything for you.

1492
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,320
Don't talk about our ...

1493
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:22,810
Throw that phone overboard.

1494
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:28,480
In a place where it is deep.

1495
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:31,000
Don't let anyone find it.

1496
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:47,950
"Throw that phone overboard."

1497
02:06:48,310 --> 02:06:49,670
"Throw it into the sea."

1498
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:54,440
"- Throw it into the deep sea." - Throw it into the deep sea.

1499
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:56,050
"Don't let anyone find him."

1500
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,890
Don't let anyone find it.

1501
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:25,950
Maybe I wanted to solve your case,

1502
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:27,670
that's why I came to Ipo.

1503
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:32,850
You hung a picture of me on the wall,

1504
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:35,480
but you can't sleep well,

1505
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,680
you only think of me.

1506
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:01,950
Song Seo-rae!

1507
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,870
Song Seo-rae, where are you?

1508
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:40,250
Hey, get HQ sent right away, a warrant for an in-person search!

1509
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:41,570
Who...

1510
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:44,590
The tide begins to rise up to the rocks!

1511
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:47,320
Bring as many colleagues as you can!

1512
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:49,500
Song Seo-rae left the car here and disappeared!

1513
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,890
We need to find it as soon as possible!

1514
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:52,980
It doesn't have to be far from here.

1515
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:57,490
Why are you asking me questions now? Move and get here quickly!

1516
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,760
Soon the tide is full, and we won't be able to see anything!

1517
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:39,380
"But lately ... I've been crazy."

1518
02:10:40,330 --> 02:10:41,890
"The investigation was corrupted, right?"

1519
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:45,600
"And what about me?"

1520
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:49,410
"I am completely destroyed."

1521
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,310
"You changed grandma's phone"

1522
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:57,950
"and you replaced it with an identical one."

1523
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,100
"She couldn't have noticed."

1524
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:03,690
"Throw that phone overboard."

1525
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:07,880
"In a place where it is deep."

1526
02:11:08,730 --> 02:11:10,130
"Don't let anyone find him."

1527
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:18,650
"Throw that phone overboard."

1528
02:11:20,430 --> 02:11:21,670
"It's your voice."

1529
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:25,750
"Your voice saying you love me."

1530
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:09,590
Seo-Rae!

1531
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:15,400
Seo-Rae!

1532
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:22,640
Seo-Rae!

1533
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:33,110
Seo-Rae!

1534
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:40,440
Seo-Rae!

1535
02:12:57,670 --> 02:12:59,410
Seo-Rae!

1536
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:17,960
Decision to Leave "La donna del mistero"

1537
02:13:22,710 --> 02:13:26,100
"Italian version: Esprit 09/2022"

1538
02:13:51,730 --> 02:13:59,730
♫ I walk alone along this deserted road. ♫

1539
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:20,860
♫ Enveloped in a thick blanket of fog. ♫

1540
02:14:32,950 --> 02:14:38,240
♫ Your shadow and your kind memories, ♫ ♫ are my only company ♫

1541
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:43,300
♫ I wander around desperately. ♫ ♫ Back to those old days. ♫

1542
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:51,330
♫ And, although it is useless, my heart always seeks. ♫

1543
02:15:02,990 --> 02:15:10,990
♫ I miss you desperately. ♫

1544
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:21,120
♫ And since nobody knows where you are, ♫

1545
02:15:23,570 --> 02:15:26,290
♫ my lonely journey in this fog, ♫

1546
02:15:28,510 --> 02:15:35,170
♫ will never end. ♫

1547
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:17,650
♫ Every time I turn around, I hear a low voice, ♫ ♫ telling my mind to surrender. ♫

1548
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:21,830
♫ Oh wind, please, ♫ ♫ blow this mist away. ♫

1549
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:30,650
♫ And since nobody knows where you are, ♫

1550
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:50,610
♫ I have to keep my eyes peeled in this fog. ♫

1551
02:16:51,980 --> 02:16:59,980
♫ And hold back my tears. ♫

1552
02:17:02,870 --> 02:17:10,870
♫ Hold back my tears. ♫
